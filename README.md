# Greet or Say Goodbye Website

This is a simple website that demonstrates a JavaScript function to greet or say goodbye to names based on certain conditions.

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, the task was to loop over an array of names and print out either a "hello" or "goodbye" to the browser console. The conditions were as follows:

- If the name starts with the letter "j" or "J", print out "Goodbye" followed by the name.
- If the name starts with any other letter, print out "Hello" followed by the name.

## Technologies Used
